# Deploying docker to EC2

This might be better than EBS because I have problems with multiple ports

https://medium.com/@chandupriya93/deploying-docker-containers-with-aws-ec2-instance-265038bba674

# For students

git archive -v -o myapp.zip --format=zip HEAD

```

npx typedoc --entryPointStrategy expand src/

```

# Notes

Default port is :80 on EBS
Example:
`codecollab-env.eba-mxadhirz.us-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com:80/api`

# socket.io and nginx
